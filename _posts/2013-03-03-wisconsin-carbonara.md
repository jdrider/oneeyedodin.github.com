This recipe is based on the classic Italian dish carbonara.  Upon actually
 reading a carbonara recipe, I found that the majority of the ingredients were 
about the only thing that the two had in common.  So I decided to call it "Wisconsin Carbonara".

   
### Ingredients   
   
* 1 lb boneless chicken breast
* 3-5 slices of bacon
* 2 eggs
* 1 lb pasta (I used penne, but almost any kind should work)
* 1 (24oz) jar of pasta sauce
* 2 Tbsp Cayenne Pepper Sauce (Hot sauce) - Optional
* 1/2 cup shredded cheese

<br />
### Servings
This should serve 5-6 adults.
  

### Instructions
   
1. Cook pasta to desired consistency
2. Preheat oven to 350&deg; F
3. Cut the chicken breast and bacon into 1/2" pieces.
4. Combine the eggs in a bowl and beat together.
5. Fry the chicken and bacon in a frying pan until the chicken is white.
6. Add the eggs to the chicken and bacon and scramble the eggs.
7. Place the bacon/chicken/egg mixture into a greased (oven safe) casserole bowl.
8. Mix in the hot sauce (if desired) and pasta sauce.
9. Stir the pasta into the mixture.
10. Place in oven for 30 minutes.
11. Take out of the oven, stir, and add shredded cheese on the top.
12. Place in the oven for about 5 minutes. (Just long enough to melt the cheese)
13. Take out of the oven, let stand for 10 minutes.
14. Enjoy!

### My Thoughts
   
I was very happy with how this recipe turned out.  One potential change would be
to add 1/4 cup of chopped onion.  If you're on the fence about whether to add 
the hot sauce, I would recommend it.  It will give the dish a noticeable "kick",
without being unbearably spicy.
