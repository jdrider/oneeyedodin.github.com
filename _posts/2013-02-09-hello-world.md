The first thing that many programmers do when learning a new language is to
write a "Hello World" application.  The purpose of this application is to allow
the programmer to get a sense of the basics of the language.  This post will serve
as a "Hello World" post for me as I get the basics of blogging with Github Pages.
I'm going to try out some various Markdown syntax to get a handle on it.

Why Use GitHub Pages for Blogging?
----------------------------------

[1]: http://www.wordpress.com "WordPress"
[2]: http://www.blogger.com "Blogger"
[3]: http://pages.github.com "GitHub Pages"

When I decided to start writing this blog, I had to figure out which service/tool
I wanted to use.  I looked into three different services, [Blogger][2], [WordPress][1], and [GitHub Pages][3].  They all have their merits, but in the end GitHub Pages was the clear winner for me.

<br />

### [GitHub Pages][3]

#### Advantages
* Free Hosting <br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp;Not much more to say here.  Who doesn't like free?

* Version Control with Git<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp;When it comes to version control, Git is my *absolute favorite*.  This blog probably won't require any fancy git usage. Also, already having a GitHub account allowed
the setup of this blog to be much faster.

* Opportunity to Learn a New Technology<br/>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;The new technology is mainly Jekyll, Jekyll Bootstrap, and Markdown.  Markdown 
is formatting language that allows these posts to be `coded`.  I haven't done 
anything too complicated with it yet but it is proving to be mucheasier to use than LaTex.

#### Disadvantages
* Semi-Steep Learning Curve<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp;I would not recommend GitHub Pages to non-programmers.  I think that it would be
a good learning experience for those that who wish to pick up web programming while
starting a blog.  However, if blogging is your **sole goal**, another service would probably be a better choice.

<br />

### [Word Press][1]
There were two main reasons that I chose not to go with WordPress.  The first being
that I would be on my own for hosting.  The second being that in some of the reviews
that I read, developers were frustrated with the limitations of WordPress.

<br />

### [Blogger][2]
Blogger was the last service that I looked into, so I didn't do as thorough of
an investigation as I did with the first two.  My impression is that it is *dead simple*
to use.  I would recommend Blogger for those who want to get started blogging
with little to no overhead.

<br />

What Can You Expect from This Blog?
-----------------------------------
Right now, I'm thinking that the posts will fall under one of three main categories.  Those categories being programming, cooking, and reactions.  Programming posts will be related to something interesting that I've done in a personal project or at work.  Posts in the cooking category will be my experiments in the kitchen.  Finally, reaction posts will be my thoughts on any issue that I deem interesting enough to write about.  So if any of those sound interesting to you, **please stay tuned**.

<br />

How Often Will New Posts be Added?
----------------------------------
I'll see how it works out.  I'm not going to commit to a schedule at this time, but I'll try to post at least every other week.
